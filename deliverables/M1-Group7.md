## Executive Summary

### Introduction – What is this report?

As a group of ten students taking the course CmpE 352, we are building an academic collaboration platform, and this is the first milestone report of our project. In the rest of this report, you can see our progress so far, what we will improve and what will come next. You can also check our deliverables.

### Description – What is Platon?

In the general frame of work, Platon is an academic collaboration platform that provides an environment for academicians to collaborate. The platform is open for anyone who has an interest in joining an academic research project. It is available on web and Android, and free to use. 

After registering and creating a profile, a user can follow other users, and meet new people to collaborate with. If a user has a well defined paper topic or a project proposal in their mind, they can post their ideas and search for collaborators. They can create a workspace and upload files, and edit those files with the other collaborators of that workspace. A user can set the privacy of a workspace they’ve created and the privacy of their profile. Private workspaces are only visible to the collaborators of that workspace and a private user profile is only accessible to another user if the user accepts the follow request of another user.

Workspaces have three states: Search for Collaborators, Ongoing, and Published states. Users can only send collaboration requests to join the public workspaces that are in the Search for Collaboration state. If a workspace is private, then the only way for the workspace owner to find collaborators is to send other users invitations.

Users can view the Activity Stream on the home page, which includes news from the accounts the user is following. They can use the recommendation system, which recommends users to workspaces and workspaces to users. They can do advanced search using filters, also the system supports semantic search.

Anyone using Platon as a guest can only search for workspaces, users, and upcoming events and see only the descriptions of the search results. To fully use the platform, they will have to register.

## Project Status – Where are we?

From the beginning of the semester, we have done several things, but the most importantly we have learnt how to work as a team. Below, there are highlights of our progress.

### Communication

In the beginning, it was even difficult to find a time that suits everyone but now, we can easily make time for the team. Making a communication plan was helpful in that manner. We created a WhatApp group and a Slack channel to keep in touch. In addition to these, we use the issue system in GitHub.

### Basics

We started the project by personalizing our GitHub repository. We added customized issue labels to the issue system, we searched for repositories so that we can use what we liked in them. We also made some research about using GitHub and version management systems. We created a wiki page in our repository, added our profiles and a picture of our group. We decided on the name our platform: Platon. It is the Greek name of Plato, who is a Greek philosopher. He had a community for people who were eager to do research – just like our platform.

### What Part

After handling the basics, we started doing the “what” part of the project by writing the requirements of the platform. To do that, we set up a meeting with the customer and asked him some questions about what he expects. After reviewing and updating the requirements as needed several times, we created user stories and mock-ups to show possible scenarios.

### How Part

Having decided what we will do, the next thing was deciding how we were going to do that. We created class and use case diagrams. After those designs, we were ready to build the sequence diagrams.

### Planning Ahead

We summarized what we did from the beginning of the semester and what we are going to do until the end of the course Cmpe 451. We made RAM and Gantt charts.

## Future Plans – Where will we be?

After this time, we will start the implementation of the platform. We still need some planning and learning to do: we need to decide who will work on each of the frontend, backend and the Android parts. We need to decide on the programming languages we will use. To decide on that, and also for the implementation part, we will do some digging about API’s, creating test cases, and how to implement our designs.

## Evaluation of Deliverables

### Communication plan

Before the COVID-19 outbreak, we used to meet once a week on Thursdays, face to face. After the classes have become online, we had to change the date and the venue – obviously. We still meet once a week for sure, and if needed, we plan another meeting. We use Zoom in general. Everyone attends the meetings unless they have a valid excuse not to attend.

### Requirements

Requirements might be the part we have updated the most. At first, we used the notes from the customer meeting and the project description to write the requirements. We were divided into three subgroups and each group took a different part of the project description to highlight the requirements. Then after the first next class, we divided ourselves into two groups again to review the requirements. Every feedback helped us find a mistake in the requirements and correct them necessarily. We believe this version of the requirements is clear enough to specify the needs of our platform.

### Scenarios and Mockups

We were divided into three groups to create three scenarios and three mockups. We supposed our scenarios and mockups were acceptable until the time that we were asked to present our scenarios, and received feedback in class directly from the instructors. Apparently, the first version of the scenarios were too long and had too many sub-scenarios in them. Later, we modified them according to the feedback we received. We think we initially could have done better if we had decided on all the details in the first meeting, because we had to meet again to decide on those.

### UML Software Designs

While designing the diagrams, we had to go back to our hometowns because of the COVID-19 outbreak, yet we managed to design the diagrams. We divided into two subgroups, for creating the use case and the class diagrams. Creating the class diagram took a lot of effort and time more than we expected. For creating the sequence diagrams, we had another meeting, people who created the use case diagrams summarized what they did, so did the class diagram makers. In fact, we designed the first sequence diagram together, which helped us all a lot. We took a feedback in class about the diagrams again and modified them according to it. We think we have stronger diagrams than the first versions.

### Project plan & RAM

To create the project plan document, we were divided into three subgroups, some wrote what we have done so far, some wrote our plan for the rest of Cmpe 352 and the remaining ones wrote our plan for Cmpe 451. Later we merged each part and created the Gantt chart. The only difficulty we had was to do calculations with dates on Excel, if we had used Project Libre right from the beginning it would have been much easier.

## Evaluation of Tools and Processes

### GitHub

Issue system of GitHub is very useful in the way that it allows its users to see the progress of an issue (when the issue was created, discussions related to that issue, when the issue is closed etc.), that we can add our custom issue labels according to our own needs,  and that one can filter issues and find the type of issues they are looking for easily.

The wiki pages can be easily updated, and each revision of a wiki page and who made that revision is tracked and different versions of a wiki page can be compared.

In short, GitHub made things more convenient for us.

### MockFlow WireframePro

MockFlow WireframePro is the tool we used to create our mockups. The wide variety of elements in the tool enabled us to create a more realistic mockup. The tool was easy to use, and the mockups were easily editable when needed.  

### Lucidchart

The tool has a big library for general purpose chart elements (arrows, boxes, circles etc.). Objects can be moved, colored and connected very easily, this feature helped us create our UML diagrams more conveniently.

### ProjectLibre

We used ProjectLibre for creating our project plan and Gantt chart. As the tool is specifically designed for creating project plans and Gantt charts, after preparing the project plan in tabular format, it quickly created a Gantt chart from the plan. Therefore, thankfully, we did not need another tool to create the Gantt chart - which could have been pretty complex to make otherwise.

## Requirements

### Glossary

**1. Account Information:** Name, surname, e-mail and affinities are necessary information. Profile photo, research, ResearchGate, and Google Scholar accounts are optional information.

**2. Activity Stream:** All activities of followed users.(State changes of their workspaces, a update in the users' workspaces)

**3. Admin:** A user who is capable of managing the whole application(Owner of the site).

**4. Collaborator:** Any user working on the same workspace.

**5. Deadline and Milestone Mechanism:** A mechanism to add deadlines for some tasks of the workspace on a timeline. This also helps users to distribute reqiurements among the collaborators so that they can keep track of the progress.

**6. Editable Files:** Markdown files(.md), any code file(.c,.py,.cpp,.java,.js,.m), txt files, .tex files, etc.

**7. Filter:** Founder of the Project, Starting Date, Submission Deadline, Research Area/Topic and labels are filters in the advanced search of the platform.

**8. Guest:** An unregistered person who uses the application.

**9. Issue:** Issue is a way to distribute requirements or task of the project/paper. An issue item consists of a description, and the user that creates that issue item. An issue consists of issue items and in addition to those,a title, a creator user(which is the user that creates the first issue item), a deadline and an assignee list.

**10. Invisible:** Any user and guest (excluding the collaborators of the workspace) don't monitor the contents of the workspace.

**11. Label:**  Related keywords about the workspace indicating the contents of the workspace. Users can search the related keywords, and find related the posts with regards to these labels. E.g. State of the Project, research field of the project, difficulty.

**12. Ongoing State:** It is the second of the three states of a project. This is the development phase of the project. After finding enough collaborators, the project will go to the second state which is the Ongoing State.

**13. Published State:** It is the last stage of a project. After milestones are completed with the request of owners of the project, the project will go to Published State.

**14. User:** A user who is registered to the system.

**15. Search for Collaborators State:**  It is the first of the three states of a project. In this state, the founder of the project waits for requests from other Users and sends invitations to Users.

**16. Semantic Search:** Semantic search is a data searching technique in which a search query aims to not only find keywords but to determine the intent and contextual meaning of the words a person is using for search.

**17. Sorting Criteria:** Date, number of collobarators needed.

**18. Terms of Use:** The legal agreements between a service provider and a person who wants to use that service.

**19. Trending Projects:** Mostly viewed projects in the platform.

**20. Upcoming Event:** Upcoming Conferences, Journal Special Issues, Submission Deadlines and CFP (call for papers) documents.

**21. Visible:** Any user inspects the contents of the workspace.

**22. Workspace:** A storage area for a group of users to develop their project/paper proposal collaboratively.

**23. Workspace Information:** Long & short description, title, labels, related upcoming events, number of collaborators needed.

**24. Workspace Related Materials:** Editable files, plots, PDF files.

## Scenarios and Mockups

### Scenario 1

#### ![](https://web.uniroma2.it/image/action/getImg/3761)

#### Persona

* Ayşin Özker
* 50 years old, female
* Professor
* Her research area is general relativity and mathematical physics.
* She loves to make research so much that sometimes she does not realize how the time flies and forgets to go home.
* Even when she is not working, she likes to stay on campus and hang out with her students.
* She chooses her assistants so meticulously that sometimes it takes months for her to decide on who will work for her.

#### User Story

Three months ago, there have been a new finding about the black holes and Aysin was selected as the head of the project. She wanted to present her finding in the 2020 The 9th International Conference on Engineering Mathematics and Physics (ICEMP 2020). Last week, all of her assistants went to a conference which was in China. The city they were staying was quarantined and because of that they had to quit the research. Aysin has to continue the research and also keep up immediately. To do that, she decides to open a private project. After that, she uses the recommendation system to find herself new assistants. She uploads her past studies. Until the end of the project, all collaborators use the platform to complete the project.

#### Preconditions

* She registered to the site two years ago to search for a PhD assistant and she found one three months after.
